# Q.1
# a = 1 / 0  # this raises a ZeroDivisionError

# Q.2
try:
    a = 1 / 0

except ZeroDivisionError:
    print(Fore.RED + "Aha!! Caught you dividing by zero!ðŸ˜ˆ")  # Adding red for angry parent effects :D


# Q.3
# Yes, The code will compile


# Q.4
# All types, Though if the finally part runs anyway - the idea of using exception tools for this code beats the point...


# Q.5
# It's the most general type of exception, so it lacks specificity for what triggered it


# Q.6
# IOError: If i try to read from a file "gold_puppies.txt" for this module for example, that will throw an IOError as it
# does not exist -> thus having a problem opening it.
# ZeroDivisionError: As we saw in the first question, this kind of error literally pops up when trying to divide by 0


# Q.7
filey = open("words.txt", "x")
filey.close()


# Q.8
filey = open("words.txt", "r+")
filey.write("Otir")
